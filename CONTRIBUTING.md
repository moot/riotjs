### Coding style

The most important:

- Leave out semicolons
- Use single quotes and not double quotes
- Prefer `==` over `===` unless it's a must
- Spacing around brackets: `if (foo) {` instead of `if(foo){`


### Use `dev` branch

Please start from `dev` branch and hand your work with a **pull request**.

##### Thank you in advance! We are happy to merge your code.
