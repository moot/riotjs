Please start from dev- branch and hand your work with a pull request.

### Coding style

The most important:

- Leave out semicolons
- Use single quotes and not double quotes
- Prefer `==` over `===` unless it's a must
- Spacing around brackets: `if (foo) {` instead of `if(foo){`


#### We are happy to merge your code. Thank you in advance!
